Pass Alarm — The alarm you never turn OFF.

Don't turn it OFF. Just skip today.
Today stays silent. Tomorrow rings on time.

<b>The problem with turning alarms OFF</b>

When you turn an alarm OFF today… it won't ring tomorrow either.
You only notice when you oversleep.

With Pass Alarm, you skip today only.
Since the alarm stays ON, there's nothing to forget.

<b>3 Key Features</b>

★ Skip Today Only
