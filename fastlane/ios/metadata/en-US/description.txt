Pass Alarm — The alarm you never turn OFF.

Don't turn it OFF. Just skip today.
Today stays silent. Tomorrow rings on time.

■ The problem with turning alarms OFF

When you turn an alarm OFF today… it won't ring tomorrow either.
You only notice when you oversleep.

With Pass Alarm, you skip today only.
Since the alarm stays ON, there's nothing to forget.

■ 3 Key Features

1. Skip Today Only
No turning OFF means no forgetting to turn it back ON.

2. Visual Queue
See upcoming alarms and swipe to skip.

3. Auto-Skip Holidays
Japanese national holidays supported. No waking up on days off.

■ How It Works

1. Set your alarm time and days
2. Tap "Skip Today" when you don't need it
3. Tomorrow it rings automatically — because you never turned it OFF
